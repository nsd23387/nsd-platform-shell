# Activity Spine API Configuration
# The shell consumes metrics from Activity Spine - this is the only data source

# Activity Spine API URL (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTIVITY_SPINE_URL=/api/activity-spine

# Activity Spine backend URL (for API proxy in development)
ACTIVITY_SPINE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Note: The shell does NOT:
# - Perform CRUD operations
# - Compute metrics locally
# - Access databases directly
# - Bypass the Activity Spine SDK
