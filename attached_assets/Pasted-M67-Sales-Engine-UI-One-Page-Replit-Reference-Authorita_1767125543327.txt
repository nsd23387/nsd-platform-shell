M67 — Sales Engine UI
One-Page Replit Reference (Authoritative)

Domain: Campaigns (Sales Engine)
API Authority: M60 only
Namespace: /api/v1/campaigns
Execution: ❌ NONE — explicitly forbidden

1. What You Are Building

You are building the Sales Engine App UI (campaigns) as a pure frontend app that will later be mounted into the NSD Command Center.

This is NOT Quote Management

This is NOT OMS

This is Campaign lifecycle + monitoring UI only

2. Allowed Endpoints (M60 Only)
READ (8 endpoints)
Purpose	Endpoint
List campaigns	GET /api/v1/campaigns?status=
Campaign detail + governance flags	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id
Metrics snapshot	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/metrics
Metrics history	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/metrics/history
Run summaries	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs
Latest run	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs/latest
Personalization variants	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/variants
Throughput config	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/throughput
WRITE (4 endpoints — lifecycle only)
Action	Endpoint	Transition
Create campaign	POST /api/v1/campaigns	→ DRAFT
Update campaign	PATCH /api/v1/campaigns/:id	DRAFT only
Submit for review	POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/submit	DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW
Approve campaign	POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/approve	PENDING_REVIEW → RUNNABLE

⚠️ /submit and /approve are WRITE operations, NOT execution

3. Lifecycle States (Must Match Exactly)
State	UI Behavior
DRAFT	Editable
PENDING_REVIEW	Read-only
RUNNABLE	Read-only
ARCHIVED	Read-only
4. Governance Metadata (MANDATORY)

Returned by:

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id

Flag	UI Responsibility
canEdit	Enable/disable editing
canSubmit	Enable/disable submit
canApprove	Enable/disable approval
isRunnable	Display only (informational)

❌ UI must not compute, override, or guess these flags.

5. Readiness & Safety (Display Only)

The UI may display readiness blockers but never act on them.

M65 Blocking Reasons (must display if present)

MISSING_HUMAN_APPROVAL

PERSISTENCE_ERRORS

NO_LEADS_PERSISTED

KILL_SWITCH_ENABLED

SMARTLEAD_NOT_CONFIGURED

INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS

Throughput Blocking Codes

DAILY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

HOURLY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

MAILBOX_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

CONFIG_INACTIVE

NO_CONFIG_FOUND

Key rule:
Passing readiness ≠ execution

6. Explicitly Forbidden (Hard Fail)

If any of the following appear → FAIL PR

❌ Execute / run / trigger / schedule campaign
❌ Any /execute, /run, /trigger, /schedule endpoints
❌ Modifying or retrying runs
❌ Direct Supabase / ODS / Edge Function usage
❌ Legacy /api/campaigns/* (non-versioned)
❌ Quotes / OMS / Item-based APIs
❌ Business logic, lifecycle logic, or policy logic in UI

7. UI Scope by M67 Milestone
Milestone	Scope
M67-02	Campaign creation & DRAFT editing
M67-03	Submit & approve (human-only)
M67-04	Execution visibility (NO execution)
M67-05	Metrics, runs, throughput monitoring
8. PR Acceptance Rule (Non-Negotiable)

A PR passes M67 only if:

Uses only the endpoints listed above

Honors governance metadata verbatim

Contains zero execution logic

Contains zero backend coupling

Treats Sales Engine as read-only beyond lifecycle writes

If anything maps outside this page → REJECT

9. Mental Model (Remember This)

The Sales Engine UI is a governed window — not a control system.
It can create, edit (DRAFT), submit, approve, and observe.
It can never execute.
