You are Replit working in the NSD Sales Engine UI repository.

THIS TASK IS A DOCUMENTATION + UI NAMING CORRECTION TASK.
It is NOT a feature build and NOT an architectural redesign.

════════════════════════════════════
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
════════════════════════════════════
This UI is a GOVERNED, READ-ONLY OBSERVABILITY INTERFACE.

You MUST NOT:
- Add execution controls, start/run buttons, or execution flows
- Add or modify campaign state machines
- Add or modify API behavior
- Add new routes that imply control or execution
- Introduce POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE semantics
- Change logic under app/sales-engine/lib/
- Reintroduce RUNNING / FAILED / COMPLETED as governance states

You MAY ONLY:
- Rename routes, tabs, and documentation language to remove execution semantics
- Improve clarity, terminology, and scope documentation
- Align replit.md with the already-implemented governed UI
- Improve wording to reduce future architectural drift
- Make UI-only naming adjustments (no logic changes)

If a change risks altering behavior → DO NOT DO IT.

════════════════════════════════════
OBJECTIVE
════════════════════════════════════
Bring Replit documentation and surface-level naming fully into alignment with the
target-state architecture:

- UI is READ-ONLY
- UI OBSERVES execution, it does not initiate it
- Governance state ≠ runtime execution state
- Backend systems own all mutations and execution
- UNKNOWN is a valid and intentional state

════════════════════════════════════
REQUIRED CHANGES
════════════════════════════════════

A) REMOVE EXECUTION SEMANTICS FROM ROUTES & NAMING
- Rename any routes, folders, or references named:
  - `execution`
  - `running`
  - `control`
- Replace with observational terminology:
  - `runs`
  - `run-history`
  - `execution-observed`
  - `delivery-observability`

Example:
❌ /sales-engine/execution
✅ /sales-engine/runs

B) GOVERNANCE STATE MODEL CORRECTION (DOCUMENTATION ONLY)
- Update replit.md to reflect UI-level governance states ONLY:
  - DRAFT
  - PENDING_REVIEW
  - APPROVED_READY
  - BLOCKED
  - EXECUTED_READ_ONLY
  - ARCHIVED
- Explicitly state:
  - RUNNING / FAILED / COMPLETED are backend runtime states
  - They appear ONLY in run history rows, never as campaign state

C) API PROXY CLARIFICATION
- Clarify that any API proxy routes:
  - Are READ-ONLY reflections of backend state
  - Do not initiate approval, submission, or execution
  - Exist only to normalize response shape and auth
- If clarification is not possible, remove proxy route documentation entirely

D) TERMINOLOGY CLEANUP
- Replace “Sales Operator Command Interface” with:
  - “Governed Campaign Observability & Approval Interface”
- Add explicit language stating:
  - “This UI never initiates execution or approval.”

════════════════════════════════════
DELIVERABLES
════════════════════════════════════
1) Updated replit.md fully aligned to target-state architecture
2) No code logic changes
3) No new routes or APIs
4) Clear wording that prevents future contributor drift

Proceed now.
