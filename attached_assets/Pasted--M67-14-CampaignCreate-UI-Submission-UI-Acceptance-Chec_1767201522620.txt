✅ M67-14 — CampaignCreate UI Submission
UI Acceptance Checklist (Authoritative)
1. Submission Flow
✅ Campaign Submission

 UI submits CampaignCreate payload only to
POST /campaign-create

 Submission includes all required sections:

campaign_identity

icp

organization_sourcing

contact_targeting

lead_qualification

outreach_context

readiness_requirements

campaign_targets (optional)

 Payload matches canonical v1 contract exactly

 No client-side mutation or reshaping of payload fields

 No derived fields added by UI

2. Success Response Handling
✅ Response Consumption

 UI consumes only fields returned by API response

 UI displays:

campaign.id

governance_state (read-only)

source_eligible (read-only)

 UI optionally displays:

icp_snapshot.id (confirmation/debug only)

 UI does NOT:

infer readiness

infer progress

infer execution state

auto-navigate to execution views

✅ Semantic Enforcement

 governance_state = DRAFT is displayed as inert

 source_eligible = false is clearly shown as not eligible

 UI text confirms:

“Campaign created in Draft state. No sourcing or execution has started.”

3. Validation Error Handling
✅ Error Rendering

 UI renders all validation_errors returned by backend

 Errors are bound to form fields using field

 Multiple errors render simultaneously

 Error messages displayed verbatim

 UI does NOT:

rewrite error messages

collapse errors into generic alerts

hide errors behind a single banner

✅ UX Integrity

 No client-side validation overrides backend rules

 Backend remains sole authority for validation semantics

4. Campaign Targets (Non-Gating)
✅ Targets Handling

 Targets are optional in UI

 UI allows:

null targets

zero values

high values

 UI does NOT:

require targets

enforce minimums

enforce caps

block submission due to targets

✅ Semantic Clarity

 UI labels targets as:

“Benchmarks only — do not affect campaign execution”

 No progress indicators tied to targets

5. Prohibited Behavior (Hard Fail)
❌ The UI MUST NOT:

 Call execution APIs

 Call sourcing APIs

 Poll campaign status

 Consume analytics or learning endpoints

 Display “running”, “active”, or “in progress”

 Show performance, attainment, or success indicators

 Trigger events or follow-on workflows

Any item above = automatic rejection

6. Data Flow & Governance
✅ Data Authority

 Backend is sole source of truth

 UI performs no eligibility computation

 UI performs no inference or classification

 UI performs no retries beyond network failure

✅ Observational Only

 UI does not observe:

sourcing results

leads

replies

metrics

learning insights

7. UX Copy & Labeling
✅ Copy Review

 No language implying execution or success

 No “Next steps” implying automation

 No “Start campaign” language

 Clear confirmation message after creation

8. Final Acceptance Gate
✅ Completion Criteria

 Submission succeeds with valid payload

 Validation errors handled correctly

 UI remains inert post-creation

 All governance constraints upheld

 No future milestones pre-wired
