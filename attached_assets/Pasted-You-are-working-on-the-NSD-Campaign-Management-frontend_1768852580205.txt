You are working on the NSD Campaign Management frontend.

Context:
- Canonical Execution Narrative Mapper (ENM) is implemented and authoritative.
- Backend now emits rich keyword-level observability:
  - org_sourcing:keyword_summary
  - org_sourcing:keyword_health
  - keywordsWithZeroResults
  - run.warning (keyword_coverage_low)
- All execution-related UI MUST consume ENM output only.
- UI must NOT interpret raw ODS events directly.

Task:
Enhance the ENM-to-UI narrative layer to clearly explain keyword behavior during org sourcing.

Requirements:

1) Keyword-Aware Execution Narrative
When ENM state = RUNNING and stage = org_sourcing:
- If keyword_health exists:
  - Show:
    “Searching organizations using multiple keywords”
  - If keywordsWithZeroResults is non-empty:
    - Show secondary copy:
      “Some keywords returned no results: boxing, crossfit”
    - Add reassurance copy:
      “Continuing with available keywords”

2) Warning-Aware UI Messaging
When ENM includes a run.warning with reason = keyword_coverage_low:
- Display a non-error warning banner:
  - Tone: informational, not alarming
  - Example:
    “Some campaign keywords produced no results. This can happen due to market density or keyword specificity.”

3) Strict UI Guardrails
The UI must NEVER:
- Show “0 organizations found” while execution is RUNNING
- Treat keyword coverage warnings as failures
- Infer broken execution from missing keyword results

4) ENM-Only Contract Enforcement
- All UI logic must derive from ENM output
- No component may read activity.events directly
- No component may compute keyword effectiveness itself

5) States to Handle Explicitly
Ensure clean narrative handling for:
- RUNNING + org_sourcing
- RUNNING + keyword_health present
- RUNNING + keyword_coverage_low warning
- COMPLETED with partial keyword success

Constraints:
- No backend changes
- No new API endpoints
- No schema changes
- No execution logic changes
- ENM remains the single source of truth

Deliverables:
- Updated ENM → UI mapping logic
- Updated user-facing copy
- Confirmation that no component reads raw ODS data
