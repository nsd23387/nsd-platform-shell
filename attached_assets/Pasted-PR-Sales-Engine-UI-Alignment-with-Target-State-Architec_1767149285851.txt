PR: Sales Engine UI Alignment with Target-State Architecture
Summary

This PR remediates gaps between the current Sales Engine UI and the target-state NSD Unified Business Platform by enforcing governance visibility, approval gating, execution readiness signaling, and brand-aligned UX patterns.

This PR does not introduce execution logic and does not mutate canonical data.

1. Campaign Lifecycle & Approval Gating (BLOCKER)
1.1 Campaign State Machine (UI)

 Introduce explicit campaign states:

 DRAFT

 PENDING_APPROVAL

 APPROVED_READY

 BLOCKED

 EXECUTED_READ_ONLY

 State must be derived from backend canonical state, not computed client-side

 Campaign list view displays state badge consistently

 Campaign detail page displays state at top (persistent)

1.2 Remove “Run” Semantics

 Replace any “Run”, “Start”, or “Launch” CTA with:

 “Submit for Approval”

 “Execution Observed” (read-only)

 No UI affordance implies immediate execution

 Tooltips explain why execution is gated

2. Execution Readiness & Gating Signals (BLOCKER)
2.1 Execution Readiness Panel

 Add read-only “Execution Readiness” section to campaign detail view

 Surface the following signals:

 Mailbox health status

 Deliverability threshold (≥95%)

 Throughput limits (current vs max)

 Kill switch state (default OFF)

 Status derived strictly from backend readiness validation

2.2 Disabled State Explanations

 Any disabled action includes inline explanation:

 “Approval required”

 “Deliverability below threshold”

 “Throughput limit reached”

 No disabled control exists without visible reasoning

3. Canonical vs Legacy Data Transparency (BLOCKER)
3.1 Data Provenance Indicators

 Introduce provenance labels:

 Canonical

 Legacy (Observed)

 Provenance visible at:

 Lead rows

 Campaign metrics

 Outcome summaries

3.2 Confidence Classification

 Display confidence level for metrics:

 Safe

 Conditional

 Blocked

 Confidence state sourced from governed analytics metadata

 Blocked metrics visually muted and non-actionable

4. Lead Model Integrity (HIGH)
4.1 Lead Abstraction Enforcement

 UI does not treat raw contact data as a Lead

 Leads only appear after qualification state

 Organization → Contact → Lead hierarchy respected in views

 No UI shortcut creates “pseudo-leads”

4.2 Copy & Labels

 Replace ambiguous labels like “Lead Count” with:

 “Qualified Leads”

 “Contacts Observed”

 Terminology matches canonical data model

5. Learning Loop Visibility (HIGH)
5.1 Learning Signal Disclosure

 Add “Learning Signals” section (read-only)

 Explicitly list:

 Signals collected

 Signals eligible for learning

 Signals excluded from automation

 Clearly indicate autonomy level (L0–L2 only)

5.2 No Implied Autonomy

 UI must not imply:

Self-optimizing campaigns

Autonomous copy changes

Automated decision-making

 Any AI output labeled “Insight-Only”

6. SLA & Operational Visibility (MEDIUM)
6.1 SLA Indicators

 Display SLA timers:

 Ingest → Queue

 Queue → Send

 Reply → First Human Response

 SLA breach indicators are read-only and explanatory

6.2 Hot Lead Escalation Visibility

 Positive reply indicators surfaced in UI

 CTA links to Slack/Triage (no in-UI action)

 No CRM mutation from UI

7. Brand & UX Alignment (MEDIUM)
7.1 Brand Accents (Subtle)

 Introduce NSD accent colors for:

 High-intent leads

 Positive outcomes

 Approved campaigns

 No neon gimmicks; restrained, confident use

7.2 Outcome Emphasis

 Positive replies visually distinguished

 High-intent segments emphasized

 Wins highlighted without gamification

8. Read-Only Guarantees (BLOCKER)

 No POST/PUT/PATCH calls from UI to canonical tables

 All mutations occur via governed backend services

 UI uses GET-only SDKs/APIs

 Confirm append-only observability tables are not mutated

9. Documentation & Reviewer Notes (REQUIRED)

 PR description includes:

 What governance gap is being closed

 What is intentionally NOT implemented

 Screenshots added for:

 Campaign states

 Disabled actions with explanations

 Confidence/provenance indicators
