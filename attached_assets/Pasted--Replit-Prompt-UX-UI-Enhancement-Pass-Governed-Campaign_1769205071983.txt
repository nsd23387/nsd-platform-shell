🎯 Replit Prompt — UX/UI Enhancement Pass (Governed Campaign Execution)

Context

You are working in the nsd-platform-shell frontend codebase.

The Campaign Details UX has already undergone:

M68 structural refactor

Post-M68 enhancement pass (canonical status copy, decision summaries, execution timeline, outcome summaries, thesis support, debug isolation)

This prompt is not for architecture changes or feature expansion.

Your role is to enhance visual clarity, hierarchy, and interaction polish while strictly preserving the existing UX logic, semantics, and governance boundaries.

Objective

Improve the UX/UI design quality of the Campaign Details experience so it:

Feels calm, intentional, and executive-grade

Communicates hierarchy and phase clearly at a glance

Reinforces trust in a governed execution system

Matches or exceeds the polish of modern infra consoles (Stripe, Vercel, Linear)

No new data. No new workflows. No new business logic.

Non-Negotiable Rules

Do not change campaign semantics or state logic

Do not introduce new statuses, metrics, or controls

Do not expose backend or debug information

Do not reintroduce tabs or dashboards

Do not add animation for animation’s sake

This is a design and interaction refinement pass only.

Design Principles to Apply

Decision-First Hierarchy

Primary Campaign Status must visually dominate

Decision Summary is the second focal point

Everything else supports context, not urgency

Phase Awareness

Pre-execution should feel anticipatory, not broken

In-execution should feel stable, not noisy

Post-execution should feel explanatory, not cluttered

Calm UI

Prefer neutral tones

Use color only to convey meaning

No alert styling unless user action is required

Narrative Flow

Top → bottom should read like a story:
Status → Decision → Intent → Timeline → Outcomes → Learning

UX/UI Enhancement Tasks
1. Visual Hierarchy Refinement

Enhance spacing, typography, and weight to reinforce importance:

PrimaryCampaignStatusBanner

Strong headline weight

Clear separation from rest of page

Subtle container background or border

DecisionSummaryPanel

Visually distinct card

Primary CTA clearly dominant

“Why?” explanations visually secondary, inline

Avoid visual competition between components.

2. Consistent Status Visual Language

Ensure all status indicators:

Use the canonical copy from status-copy.ts

Share consistent color semantics

Avoid mixed iconography styles

Draft a small internal mapping:

Neutral (Draft, Pending)

Positive (Approved, Completed)

Active (Running)

Exceptional (Stopped, Failed)

No red unless the state truly requires attention.

3. Execution Timeline UX Polish

Enhance ExecutionTimeline readability:

Clear vertical rhythm between stages

Visual compression of completed stages post-execution

Subtle emphasis on terminal stage

Duration badges styled as secondary metadata

Timeline should read as sequence, not metrics.

4. Outcome Summary Visual Framing

Improve CampaignOutcomeSummary presentation:

Treat it like a “run report”

Use restrained typography

Group metrics logically (volume, conversion, duration)

Keep it narrative, not dashboard-like

This section should feel conclusive and trustworthy.

5. Campaign Thesis Styling

Enhance thesis rendering:

Use quotation or callout styling

Subtle emphasis without overpowering intent scope

Clearly optional; hidden when absent

This supports recall and auditability.

6. Empty & Informational States

Ensure all empty states:

Use informational tone

Never imply error or misconfiguration

Are visually calm and neutral

Examples:

“Not started yet”

“Available after execution”

“No learning insights generated for this run”

7. Interaction Polish (Micro-UX)

Light enhancements allowed:

Hover states

Focus states

Subtle transitions (opacity, spacing)

Not allowed:

Complex animations

Loading spinners unless data is actually loading

Visual jitter

Acceptance Criteria

Page can be understood in under 5 seconds

Visual hierarchy clearly communicates importance

No section feels noisy, anxious, or broken

Design reinforces governance and trust

UX matches the maturity of the underlying architecture

Deliverable

A visually refined, interaction-polished Campaign Details experience that adheres strictly to the existing UX semantics while elevating design quality.
