🔒 REPLIT BUILD MANDATE — M67 SALES ENGINE UI (AUTHORITATIVE)
READ THIS FIRST — NON-NEGOTIABLE

You are building the Sales Engine UI for Neon Signs Depot.

This is a campaign management system, NOT a quote system.

You must implement ALL functionality described below exactly as specified.
Do NOT invent endpoints, do NOT omit features, do NOT merge quote logic, and do NOT introduce execution authority.

Failure to follow this mandate will result in rejection.

1. Application Identity & Scope

Application Name: Sales Engine
Domain Entity: Campaigns
API Namespace: /api/v1/campaigns/*
Execution Authority: ❌ NONE
Scheduling Authority: ❌ NONE
Quote Management: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE

This UI does not:

Execute campaigns

Trigger runs

Schedule outreach

Manage quotes

Price anything

Call Smartlead directly

Access databases or Supabase directly

2. Architectural Rules (Hard Constraints)
2.1 API Usage (MANDATORY)

You may ONLY call the following APIs:

READ (8 endpoints)

GET /api/v1/campaigns

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/metrics

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/metrics/history

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs/latest

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/variants

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/throughput

WRITE (4 endpoints)

POST /api/v1/campaigns → always creates DRAFT

PATCH /api/v1/campaigns/:id → DRAFT only

POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/submit → DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW

POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/approve → PENDING_REVIEW → RUNNABLE

❌ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)

/execute

/run

/trigger

/schedule

Any non-versioned /api/campaigns/*

Any /quotes/* endpoints

3. Governance Rules (MANDATORY)

The UI must render governance verbatim from the API:

Governance Flags (from GET /campaigns/:id)

canEdit

canSubmit

canApprove

isRunnable

UI Behavior Rules

If canEdit === false → no editing UI

If canSubmit === false → hide submit CTA

If canApprove === false → hide approve CTA

If isRunnable === true → show runnable state WITHOUT execution controls

You may NOT infer, calculate, or override governance logic.

4. Required Pages (ALL MUST EXIST)
4.1 Campaign Index

Route: /sales-engine

Must show:

All campaigns

Status badges (DRAFT, PENDING_REVIEW, RUNNABLE, ARCHIVED)

Governance icons

Create Campaign CTA

4.2 Campaign Builder (DRAFT ONLY)

Routes:

/sales-engine/campaigns/new

/sales-engine/campaigns/:id/edit

4.3 Campaign Review (PENDING_REVIEW)

4.8 Throughput & Safety

Route: /sales-engine/campaigns/:id/safety

5. Safety & Blocking States (MANDATORY)

You must surface ALL M65 blocking reasons verbatim:

MISSING_HUMAN_APPROVAL

PERSISTENCE_ERRORS

KILL_SWITCH_ENABLED

SMARTLEAD_NOT_CONFIGURED

INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS

And ALL throughput blocks:

DAILY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

HOURLY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

MAILBOX_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

CONFIG_INACTIVE

NO_CONFIG_FOUND

No translations. No summaries. No hiding.

6. Visual & Brand Requirements (NON-OPTIONAL)
Brand Reference

neonsignsdepot.com

Visual Rules

Clean, modern, high whitespace

No SaaS-default gray dashboards

No admin-template look

Confident, premium, signage-brand feel

Neon accents used sparingly

Typography and color hierarchy must feel intentional

❌ Do not reuse Command Center dashboard visuals
❌ Do not use placeholder admin UI patterns

This is a revenue-critical product UI, not an internal metrics dashboard.

7. Platform Shell Integration

Build Sales Engine as a standalone app

It will later be registered inside NSD Command Center

Do NOT inherit Command Center assumptions

Do NOT remove functionality to fit shell constraints

8. Acceptance Criteria (ALL REQUIRED)

You are done ONLY when:

 All pages listed above exist

 AI Campaign Generator exists and is editable

 All governance flags are respected

 No execute or schedule UI exists

 Metrics, runs, throughput are visible

 Branding matches NeonSignsDepot.com

 Zero quote references exist

 Zero non-M60 APIs are called

9. Final Warning

If:

Quotes appear anywhere

Execution buttons exist

AI generator is missing

Campaign lifecycle is incomplete

Visuals look generic

➡️ The build will be rejected.

This mandate defines the Sales Engine UI completely and exhaustively.
Build exactly this. No shortcuts. No assumptions. No omissions.
