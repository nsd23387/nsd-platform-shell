🔹 Replit Prompt — M67 Sales Engine UI (Authoritative)

You are building the Sales Engine Application UI, not the NSD Platform Shell or Command Center.

This is a standalone React application whose sole purpose is to manage campaigns via the governed M60 API surface.

⚠️ Do NOT reuse or extend the NSD Command Center dashboard patterns. Treat this as a clean product UI.

Scope (Non-Negotiable)

Build a standalone Sales Engine app

Consume ONLY /api/v1/campaigns/* APIs

Implement end-to-end campaign lifecycle UI

No dashboards, no app registry, no shell behavior

No quotes domain

No execution triggers

Required Pages (Must Implement All)

Campaign List

Create Campaign (DRAFT)

Campaign Overview

Edit Campaign (DRAFT-only)

Submit for Review

Approval UI

Monitoring (metrics, runs, throughput)

Governance Rules (Must Enforce)

Render governance flags exactly:

canEdit

canSubmit

canApprove

isRunnable

UI must never infer permissions

/submit and /approve are WRITE lifecycle actions, not execution

NO EXECUTE ENDPOINTS EXIST

Readiness visibility ≠ execution

Explicit Prohibitions

❌ No /api/v1/me

❌ No app registry

❌ No dashboards

❌ No quotes APIs

❌ No execution buttons

❌ No scheduling

❌ No shell navigation assumptions

Design & UX

Use NSD design tokens

Minimal, whitespace-first

Flat components

No glow/neon effects

Status-driven affordances only

Deliverables

Fully navigable Sales Engine UI

Correct routing per page map

All campaign lifecycle flows implemented

Ready for STAGING API wiring (M68)

3️⃣ Why Replit Built the Wrong Thing (Root Cause)

Yes — connecting to the platform shell repo absolutely caused this.

What Happened

Replit saw:

/api/v1/me

dashboards

app registry

read-only posture

It inferred:

“We are extending the Command Center”

Why That’s Dangerous

Shell repos bias toward:

aggregation

read-only views

feature gating

Sales Engine requires:

domain workflows

lifecycle transitions

human-in-the-loop actions

Prevention Going Forward

M67 work must:

Live in its own app context

Reference Sales Engine contract only

Ignore Shell concerns until M68
