✅ Replit Build Prompt

Title: Add Sales Engine Dashboard to Homepage (Read-Only, Governed)

CONTEXT (DO NOT SKIP)

You are working inside the NSD Sales Engine UI (M67).
This UI is read-only except for explicitly governed actions and must only consume M60 Campaign Management APIs.

You are NOT building:

Executive dashboards

Business-wide KPIs

Revenue or order metrics

Any automation or execution logic

You ARE building:

A Sales Engine–scoped dashboard

Focused on campaign health, readiness, throughput, and recent outcomes

Fully read-only

Rendered on the Sales Engine homepage

No new backend logic.
No new API endpoints.
No calculations in the UI.

OBJECTIVE

Add a Sales Engine Dashboard to the homepage of the existing Sales Engine UI, positioned above the campaign list, providing operators immediate visibility into:

Campaign health

Readiness blockers

Throughput utilization

Recent run outcomes

System notices

This dashboard must not duplicate the NSD Command Center.

DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
1️⃣ Campaign Health Summary (Top Row – KPI Cards)

Purpose: Quick state awareness

Display the following counts:

Total Campaigns

Draft

Pending Review

Runnable

Archived

Rules

Read-only

No click-to-execute

Clicking a count may filter the campaign list only

2️⃣ Readiness & Safety Blockers Panel

Purpose: Explain why campaigns cannot run

Display grouped counts by blocker reason:

Missing human approval

Kill switch active

No leads persisted

Throughput limit reached

Smartlead not configured

Insufficient credits

Rules

Use blocker codes returned by API verbatim

No inference logic in UI

No “fix” buttons

3️⃣ Throughput Utilization Snapshot

Purpose: Capacity awareness

Display:

Daily send cap (configured vs remaining)

Active campaigns contributing to throughput

Blocked-by-throughput count

Rules

All values must come from backend

UI must not compute percentages

Display only what API provides

4️⃣ Recent Campaign Run Outcomes

Purpose: Operational feedback loop

For last N runs (or per campaign latest run), show:

Campaign name

Last run timestamp

Leads attempted

Leads sent

Leads blocked

Run status (SUCCESS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED)

Rules

Read-only table or cards

No replay / rerun buttons

No drill-downs beyond campaign detail page

5️⃣ System Notices (Non-Interactive)

Purpose: Governance visibility

Examples:

Kill switch enabled

Analytics lag detected

Smartlead quota warning

Rules

Informational only

No dismiss / action buttons

Render exactly as returned

UI PLACEMENT (MANDATORY)
Sales Engine Home
├── Sales Engine Dashboard (NEW)
│   ├── Campaign Health Summary
│   ├── Readiness Blockers
│   ├── Throughput Snapshot
│   ├── Recent Run Outcomes
│   └── System Notices
└── Campaign List (Existing)


Dashboard must appear above the campaign table

Use existing design system (spacing, typography, cards)

Maintain Neon Signs Depot brand alignment (clean, high-contrast, minimal)

API CONSUMPTION RULES (CRITICAL)

Only call M60 APIs

No direct DB access

No ODS access

No Smartlead direct calls

No derived metrics in frontend

No side effects

If required data does not exist in API response:
➡️ Display nothing (do not guess or compute)

GOVERNANCE CONSTRAINTS (HARD FAIL IF VIOLATED)

❌ No execution triggers

❌ No approval actions

❌ No automation

❌ No revenue or order metrics

❌ No cross-domain aggregation

❌ No duplication of Command Center KPIs

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

 Dashboard renders on Sales Engine homepage

 All data is read-only

 All metrics sourced from M60 APIs

 No UI-side calculations

 No execution or mutation paths

 Matches existing design language

 Campaign list remains unchanged

 Safe to deploy to STAGING

📊 UI → API Mapping Table (Visualization Aid)
Dashboard Section	UI Element	API Source (M60)	Notes
Campaign Health	Total / Draft / Review / Runnable counts	GET /api/v1/campaigns	Filter by status server-side
Readiness Blockers	Blocker reason counts	GET /api/v1/campaigns/readiness	Render codes verbatim
Throughput Snapshot	Cap / remaining / blocked	GET /api/v1/campaigns/throughput	No UI math
Recent Runs	Latest run summary	GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs/latest	Read-only
System Notices	Warnings / flags	GET /api/v1/system/notices	Informational only
🧭 Architectural Note (For Replit)

This dashboard is Sales Engine–scoped operational visibility, not an executive KPI surface.
Do not introduce abstractions that would move this toward a Command Center.
