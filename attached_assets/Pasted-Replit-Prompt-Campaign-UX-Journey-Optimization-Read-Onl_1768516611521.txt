Replit Prompt — Campaign UX & Journey Optimization (Read-Only)

Context
You are working inside the NSD Platform Shell UI on the Sales Engine campaign experience.

The execution explainability feature has been completed and approved.
Now perform a UX / IA inspection of the entire campaign journey, with the goal of making each campaign self-explanatory, reviewable, and actionable without navigation elsewhere.

🔒 Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

❌ NO backend changes

❌ NO schema changes

❌ NO new API endpoints

❌ NO mutations or edits

❌ NO campaign configuration logic

❌ NO inference beyond existing data

✅ READ-ONLY UI only

This is visibility and clarity only.

🎯 Goal

A user viewing a campaign detail page should be able to answer, in under 15 seconds:

What is this campaign targeting?

What criteria define its scope?

Where in the funnel is it?

What happened during execution?

What should I do next?

All without leaving the page.

🧠 Required UX Enhancements
1. Campaign Scope Panel (HIGH PRIORITY)

Surface read-only ICP configuration directly in the campaign detail view.

This includes (only if already available via existing data):

Target industries / keywords

Company size range

Geography

Any explicit ICP filters used

Format as a compact, scannable summary, e.g.:

Campaign Scope
────────────────────────
Industries: Fitness, Gyms, Boxing
Company Size: 11–50 employees
Location: California


Rules:

Read-only

No editing

No deep nesting

No abbreviations without labels

2. Funnel Visibility Panel

Show the current funnel state, even if empty.

Example:

Pipeline Funnel
────────────────────────
Organizations sourced: 0
Contacts discovered: 0
Leads enriched: 0
Messages sent: 0


Empty funnel must be presented as valid, not broken.

3. Journey Anchoring (Context Awareness)

Ensure the user always sees:

Campaign name

Campaign status

Execution confidence badge

Scope summary

These should be above the fold.

4. Reduce Cognitive Load

Collapse secondary details behind toggles

Promote summary blocks

Remove redundant status language

Ensure each section answers a single question

5. Forward Momentum Callouts

When appropriate, show advisory-only guidance:

“Review ICP criteria if results are empty”

“Execution completed successfully — you can create another campaign or refine this one”

No CTAs should mutate data.

🧪 Acceptance Criteria

This task is complete when:

A user does not need to navigate to another page to understand campaign scope

ICP criteria are visible without editing

Funnel emptiness is clearly explained

The page feels reviewable, not operational

No backend changes were made

No logic was duplicated

🧭 Guiding Principle

A campaign detail page should read like a summary report, not a control panel.

If something feels actionable, hide it.
If something feels ambiguous, clarify it.

6️⃣ Recommendation

Run this prompt now.

You’re in the exact right sequence:

Execution explainability ✅

Campaign clarity & scope visibility ⬅️ now

Funnel effectiveness & optimization (later)

Runtime enhancements (optional)

This keeps momentum high and avoids premature backend work.
