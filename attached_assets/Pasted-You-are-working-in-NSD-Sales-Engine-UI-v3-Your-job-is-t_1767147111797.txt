You are working in NSD Sales Engine UI (v3). Your job is to produce v4 with the following non-negotiable requirements.

GOAL
- This Sales Engine UI must reflect the REAL Sales Engine lifecycle and M60 governed API contract.
- Remove all “mock backend” behavior and align UI + copy to NSD brand (neonsignsdepot.com look/feel).
- Add a Sales Engine “at-a-glance” dashboard on the Sales Engine Home page (permitted if it only reads governed metrics endpoints).

A) ARCHITECTURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1) Remove local mock APIs and mock data sources
- Identify ALL Next.js route handlers under app/api/v1/*
- They currently return mockCampaigns and mocked responses.
- Replace them with a thin API client layer that calls the REAL governed API (M60) via env var base URL.
- No business logic in UI or in route handlers. If route handlers remain, they may ONLY proxy requests to M60 (no transforms beyond passthrough + error mapping).

2) Environment configuration
- Introduce env vars:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_ENGINE_API_BASE_URL (staging first)
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_ODS_API_URL (only if needed for /api/v1/me bootstrap)
- Hard rule: UI must not talk to Supabase directly. No DB coupling. No service_role keys. No RLS bypass.

3) Auth + Bootstrap (do not invent RBAC)
- Bootstrap must come from GET {ODS_API}/api/v1/me (or the canonical identity endpoint used in Platform Shell).
- Do not parse JWT. Do not infer permissions. Use permissions/feature_visibility from bootstrap only.
- Feature gating: if user lacks Sales Engine access, show a clean “No access” state.

B) GLOBAL COPY CHANGE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Eliminate the word “Runnable” everywhere in the UI.
- Backend state may still be RUNNABLE in payloads, but UI must display:
  - RUNNABLE => “Approved & Ready”
- Fix lingering strings:
  - app/sales-engine/campaigns/[id]/readiness/page.tsx: remove “Campaign is in RUNNABLE state.”
  - app/sales-engine/campaigns/[id]/governance/page.tsx: remove “transition to RUNNABLE state”
- Replace with operator language:
  - “Approved & Ready: Eligible to start. All checks passed.”

C) BEFORE/AFTER PAGE MAP (IN PR DESCRIPTION)
Include a short before/after map in the PR description.

BEFORE (v3)
- /sales-engine/home
- /sales-engine/campaigns
- /sales-engine/campaigns/new
- /sales-engine/campaigns/[id]
- /sales-engine/campaigns/[id]/governance
- /sales-engine/campaigns/[id]/readiness
- /sales-engine/campaigns/[id]/execute
- /sales-engine/monitoring

AFTER (v4) – REQUIRED
- /sales-engine/home  (now includes aggregate dashboard + “Needs Attention” queue)
- /sales-engine/campaigns (table + filters + status chips + quick actions)
- /sales-engine/campaigns/new (campaign form + AI generator)
- /sales-engine/campaigns/[id] (overview + tabs)
  Tabs:
   - Setup (edit draft fields; read-only if not DRAFT)
   - Review (governance checklist; submit to REVIEW)
   - Approvals (approve/reject with confirmation; only when in REVIEW)
   - Execution (start run with confirmations; only when Approved & Ready)
   - Monitoring (run history, snapshots, errors; read-only)

D) SALES ENGINE HOME DASHBOARD (NEW REQUIREMENT)
On /sales-engine/home add:
1) KPI strip (read-only):
- Drafts
- In Review
- Approved & Ready
- Running
- Completed (last 7d)
- Failed / Blocked (if available)
2) “Needs Attention” queue (top 5–10 campaigns):
- In Review older than X hours
- Approved & Ready but not started
- Runs with failures/errors
Each row: Campaign name, status, last updated, primary CTA.

IMPORTANT: all values must come from governed read endpoints.
No calculations beyond basic formatting.

E) NSD BRAND ALIGNMENT (MATCH NEONSIGNSDEPOT.COM)
- Adopt NSD design tokens and spacing rules:
  - Primary: Deep Indigo #020F5A
  - Secondary: Violet #692BAA
  - CTA only: Magenta #CC368F (sparingly)
  - Background: white
  - High whitespace, clean borders, minimal shadows
  - No neon glow effects, no heavy gradients
- Typography:
  - Poppins headings, Inter body (already present)
- Replace inline styles with a consistent component system.
  - Introduce shared layout components (PageHeader, SectionCard, StatCard, StatusChip, DataTable).
  - Ensure consistent paddings, margins, and responsive behavior.

F) CAMPAIGN FORM + AI CAMPAIGN GENERATOR (CONFIRMATION)
- The Campaign Creation flow MUST include:
  - Full campaign form fields (as previously designed)
  - AI Campaign Generator panel that can draft/populate the form
  - Human remains authoritative: AI suggestions require explicit “Apply” action
  - No auto-save from AI without user confirmation
- Ensure the form aligns with the backend campaign schema (M52/M60) and supports DRAFT save + edit.

G) UX SUCCESS CHECKLIST (IN PR DESCRIPTION)
Include a “Sales Engine UX Success Checklist” in the PR description with checkboxes, including:
- [ ] Home dashboard shows correct totals by status
- [ ] “Needs Attention” queue routes to the correct next action
- [ ] Status language uses Approved & Ready (never Runnable)
- [ ] Campaign table supports filtering by status + search by name
- [ ] Draft can be created, saved, re-opened, edited
- [ ] Review step clearly explains what changes when submitting to review
- [ ] Approval step requires explicit confirmation and logs result
- [ ] Execution step requires explicit confirmation and shows safety warnings
- [ ] Monitoring is read-only and shows run history + snapshots
- [ ] Errors show user-friendly messages with retry where allowed
- [ ] Brand tokens match NSD website look/feel (white space, indigo/violet, magenta CTA only)

DELIVERABLES
- Working v4 UI with real governed API wiring (staging base URL)
- PR includes before/after page map + UX success checklist
- No mock APIs remaining (or only proxy passthrough with real backend)
- Runnable removed from UI copy globally
