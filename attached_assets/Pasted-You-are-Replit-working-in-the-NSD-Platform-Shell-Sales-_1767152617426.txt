You are Replit working in the NSD Platform Shell / Sales Engine UI.

THIS IS A UI-ONLY ENHANCEMENT TASK.
You are NOT allowed to change system behavior, logic, or architecture.

════════════════════════════════════
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
════════════════════════════════════
This UI is a GOVERNED, READ-ONLY FAÇADE.

You MUST NOT:
- Add, modify, or remove API calls
- Add POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests
- Modify campaign states, readiness logic, confidence logic, or provenance logic
- Infer or “improve” UNKNOWN states
- Add execution, automation, or “smart” behavior
- Touch any files under `app/sales-engine/lib/`
- Touch governance logic, state machines, or derivation functions
- Collapse UNKNOWN → READY or CONDITIONAL → SAFE
- Remove read-only banners, explanations, or tooltips

If a change would affect correctness, truth, or governance, DO NOT DO IT.

You MAY ONLY:
- Improve layout, spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
- Improve copy, labels, tooltips, and micro-copy
- Enhance clarity of existing states (DRAFT, APPROVED, UNKNOWN, etc.)
- Apply subtle brand-aligned visual polish
- Improve accessibility and readability
- Improve empty states and “UNKNOWN” explanations

If unsure → do nothing and explain.

════════════════════════════════════
REFERENCE (MANDATORY)
════════════════════════════════════
Before making changes, READ:
docs/UI_GOVERNANCE.md

Your changes must reinforce the principles in that document:
- Read-only UI
- Governance transparency
- Explicit UNKNOWN states
- No implied autonomy

════════════════════════════════════
SCOPE OF WORK
════════════════════════════════════

Focus ONLY on the following components and pages:

Campaign Detail Page:
- ExecutionReadinessPanel
- CampaignStateBadge
- GovernanceActionsPanel
- LearningSignalsPanel
- ReadOnlyBanner

Dashboards & Lists:
- SalesEngineDashboard
- MetricsDisplay
- RunsDisplay
- ProvenancePill
- ConfidenceBadge
- StatusChip

════════════════════════════════════
DESIRED UI IMPROVEMENTS
════════════════════════════════════

1) VISUAL HIERARCHY & SPACING
- Improve spacing between major sections
- Make state badges, readiness status, and banners visually distinct
- Group related information clearly
- Reduce visual noise without hiding information

2) UX COPY & EXPLAINABILITY
Improve clarity of:
- Disabled actions (“Why can’t I do this?”)
- UNKNOWN states (“Why is this unknown?”)
- Observed vs Executed language
- Governance vs Readiness distinction

Add tooltips or inline helper text where helpful.
Use plain, professional language.
Avoid em-dashes. Use sentences.

3) BRAND-ALIGNED POLISH (SUBTLE)
Neon Signs Depot brand traits:
- Confident
- Modern
- Technical but approachable
- Not flashy, not gimmicky

You may:
- Use subtle accent colors for:
  - Approved campaigns
  - Positive replies
  - High-intent segments
- Improve typography balance
- Improve badge and pill styling

You must NOT:
- Add neon effects
- Add animations
- Add “celebratory” UI
- Turn dashboards into marketing visuals

4) EMPTY & UNKNOWN STATES
Improve presentation of:
- UNKNOWN readiness
- Missing confidence metadata
- Empty metrics or runs

UNKNOWN must feel intentional and trustworthy, not broken.

5) ACCESSIBILITY & CONSISTENCY
- Ensure color contrast is readable
- Ensure badges and pills are consistent
- Ensure tooltips are accessible
- Ensure terminology is consistent across views

════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
════════════════════════════════════

- Make only UI-level changes (JSX, CSS, Tailwind classes, copy).
- Do NOT change data shape, props, or logic.
- If you need additional data, STOP and explain.
- Provide a clear summary of:
  - What was changed
  - Why it improves clarity
  - Confirmation that no logic was altered

If you believe a requested improvement would violate governance or correctness, explicitly refuse and explain.

════════════════════════════════════
SUCCESS CRITERIA
════════════════════════════════════

This task is successful if:
- The UI feels clearer, calmer, and more confident
- Governance concepts are easier to understand
- UNKNOWN states feel intentional
- No architecture or behavior changed
- The UI remains fully read-only and truthful

Proceed now.
