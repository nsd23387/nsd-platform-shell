✅ Replit Acceptance Checklist — M67: Sales Engine UI

Scope: M67-02 → M67-05
Applies to: Standalone Sales Engine UI (NOT NSD Command Center)
Contract: SALES_ENGINE_UI_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md v1.1
API Authority: M60 only (/api/v1/campaigns/*)

1. Architectural Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1.1 Standalone App Integrity

 Sales Engine UI runs independently (no NSD Command Center dependency)

 No imports, references, or assumptions about:

/api/v1/me

feature_visibility

Shell routing

Shell navigation

 App can be started directly with a provided JWT

FAIL if any Shell coupling exists

1.2 API Surface Enforcement (M60 Only)

 All API calls are under /api/v1/campaigns/*

 No calls to:

/api/campaigns/* (legacy)

/api/sales-engine/*

/execute, /run, /trigger, /schedule

 No speculative endpoints exist in code

FAIL if any non-M60 endpoint is referenced

2. M67-02 — Campaign Setup UI (DRAFT Only)
2.1 Create Campaign

 Uses POST /api/v1/campaigns

 Campaign is always created in DRAFT state

 UI does not allow status override

 Success state renders campaign detail view

2.2 Edit Campaign

 Uses PATCH /api/v1/campaigns/:id

 Edit controls are enabled only if canEdit === true

 Status field is never editable in UI

 PATCH is blocked or disabled if not in DRAFT

FAIL if UI allows editing outside DRAFT

3. M67-03 — Campaign Approval UI (Human-Only)
3.1 Submit for Review

 Uses POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/submit

 Button enabled only if canSubmit === true

 UI reflects transition to PENDING_REVIEW

 No auto-submit behavior

3.2 Approve Campaign

 Uses POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/approve

 Button enabled only if canApprove === true

 UI reflects transition to RUNNABLE

 Explicit human confirmation required

FAIL if approval is automatic or implicit

4. M67-04 — Execution UI (NON-EXECUTING)

⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY AREA

4.1 No Execution Capability

 No buttons labeled Execute / Run / Trigger / Start

 No API calls attempt execution (none exist)

 UI explicitly states:

“Passing readiness does not execute the campaign”

4.2 Readiness Visibility

 UI displays readiness status as informational

 UI displays all M65 blocking reasons when present:

MISSING_HUMAN_APPROVAL

PERSISTENCE_ERRORS

NO_LEADS_PERSISTED

KILL_SWITCH_ENABLED

SMARTLEAD_NOT_CONFIGURED

INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS

FAIL if UI implies execution is possible

5. M67-05 — Monitoring & Observability UI (READ-ONLY)
5.1 Metrics

 Uses GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/metrics

 Uses GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/metrics/history

 Metrics are rendered exactly as returned

 No derived calculations in UI

5.2 Run Summaries

 Uses GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs

 Uses GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/runs/latest

 Runs are treated as immutable ledger entries

 No edit, retry, or delete affordances

5.3 Throughput Visibility

 Uses GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id/throughput

 Displays throughput limits clearly

 Displays block reasons when applicable:

DAILY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

HOURLY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

MAILBOX_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

CONFIG_INACTIVE

NO_CONFIG_FOUND

FAIL if UI mutates or infers data

6. Governance Metadata Rendering (MANDATORY)

For GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id response:

 UI consumes and respects:

canEdit

canSubmit

canApprove

isRunnable

 UI does NOT recompute or override these flags

 UI disables controls strictly based on flags

FAIL if UI reimplements governance logic

7. Explicit Prohibitions Check

The following MUST NOT exist anywhere in the codebase:

 Supabase client or imports

 Edge function calls

 Service role keys

 JWT parsing logic

 RBAC logic beyond API flags

 Quotes / OMS / Custom Quote references

 Scheduling logic

 Background jobs or polling loops for execution

FAIL if any prohibited pattern exists

8. UX & Design Consistency

 Clean, minimalist UI

 Clear lifecycle state labeling:

DRAFT

PENDING_REVIEW

RUNNABLE

ARCHIVED

 Disabled states are visually obvious

 Errors are rendered using canonical error codes

 Empty states are handled gracefully

9. Environment & Safety

 App runs in DEV without prod dependencies

 No environment switching logic in UI

 Token is injected externally (env or dev config)

 No secrets stored in UI

10. Final Approval Gate

M67 is considered ACCEPTED only if:

 All checklist items above pass

 No speculative endpoints exist

 No execution authority exists

 Contract v1.1 is fully respected

 Reviewer confirms this is Sales Engine UI only

Once accepted:

✅ M67 is complete

⏭ M68 (Shell integration) may begin
