Replit Prompt — M67 Sales Engine UI (REVISED)

You are implementing M67 – Sales Engine UI as a standalone frontend application.

This application MUST be developed independently of the NSD Command Center.

Core Principle

The Sales Engine UI is a self-contained product UI that consumes only the governed M60 Campaign Management APIs (/api/v1/campaigns/*).
Platform Shell (NSD Command Center) integration, routing, bootstrap, and feature visibility are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE and will be handled later in M68.

Scope (M67 Only)

Implement the following UI capabilities:

M67-02 — Campaign Setup UI

Create, edit, and manage campaigns in DRAFT state

Uses:

POST /api/v1/campaigns

PATCH /api/v1/campaigns/:id

No lifecycle transitions beyond DRAFT

M67-03 — Campaign Approval UI

Human-driven submission and approval flow

Uses:

POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/submit

POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/approve

UI must render governance flags:

canEdit

canSubmit

canApprove

isRunnable

M67-04 — Campaign Execution UI (NON-EXECUTING)

Display readiness and blocked state only

NO execute, run, trigger, schedule, or cancel actions

Must display:

M65 blocking reasons

Throughput constraints

Explicitly communicate:

“Passing readiness ≠ execution”

M67-05 — Campaign Monitoring UI

Read-only observability

Uses:

/metrics

/metrics/history

/runs

/runs/latest

/variants

/throughput

Explicit Non-Goals (Hard Constraints)

❌ Do NOT integrate with NSD Command Center

❌ Do NOT use /api/v1/me

❌ Do NOT implement feature gating or RBAC logic

❌ Do NOT parse JWTs

❌ Do NOT add execution endpoints (none exist)

❌ Do NOT reference quotes, OMS, or custom quote systems

Technical Expectations

Frontend-only application

React-based SPA

JWT is assumed to be provided externally (environment or dev token)

All API calls go directly to /api/v1/campaigns/*

No backend, no server, no database access

Acceptance Criteria

App can run independently in DEV with a provided token

All UI states map correctly to M60 APIs

No speculative or fabricated endpoints

No execution authority introduced

Fully compliant with Sales Engine UI Architecture Contract v1.1

If a required capability cannot be implemented using the documented M60 APIs, STOP and report the gap instead of inventing endpoints.
