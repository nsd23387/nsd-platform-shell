✅ Replit Prompt — Target-State Execution-Aware UX Audit & Design Plan (UI-Only, No Implementation Yet)

You are working in the nsd-platform-shell repository (frontend UI only).

This task is UX and information-architecture planning only.
Do NOT implement code changes yet.
Your output should be a design-level recommendation and task plan for approval.

Context (Authoritative)

The system follows a governed, stage-based execution architecture.
Campaigns progress through a multi-stage lifecycle, some of which are already implemented and some planned.

Canonical Execution Stages (Authoritative)

Assume the campaign lifecycle includes the following ordered stages, even if some are not yet live:

org_sourcing

contact_discovery

lead_qualification (promotion)

email_readiness (email present / enrichment pending)

personalization_generation

outbound_activation (e.g., Smartlead connection)

send_in_progress

send_completed

Important constraints:

The UI is observational only

The UI must not invent backend state

Some stages may not yet emit events — design must still anticipate them

Canonical truth always comes from observed backend data and ODS events

Objective

Re-evaluate the entire frontend UX assuming the full execution lifecycle above will exist.

Your task is to ensure the UI:

Scales cleanly as new execution stages come online

Avoids future navigation or layout rework

Clearly communicates where a campaign is in the full lifecycle

Makes it obvious what action (if any) is required next

Preserves governance and non-prescriptive semantics

What To Analyze
1. Global Navigation

Assess whether current navigation will still make sense once stages like:

personalization

outbound activation

sending
are visible.

Identify:

Which views become redundant

Which views should be lifecycle-oriented (not page-oriented)

Whether navigation labels remain accurate over time

⚠️ Do NOT rename or merge pages yet — only recommend.

2. Campaign Detail Page (Critical)

Assume the Campaign Detail page must eventually tell a complete execution story from sourcing → sending.

Evaluate:

Whether the current execution-first layout can naturally extend past lead promotion

Where future stages would appear visually

Whether stage tracking should remain vertical, horizontal, or hybrid

How to show:

“Waiting on email readiness”

“Personalization not yet generated”

“Outbound not connected”

“Sending in progress”

Design goal:

A user should understand the entire lifecycle of a campaign by scrolling one page.

3. Actions Required Model

Assess how approvals and actions should evolve once actions become stage-specific, not campaign-wide.

Examples:

Approve personalization batch

Resolve missing email coverage

Connect outbound system

Resume paused sends

Evaluate:

Whether “Actions Required” should remain a page, list, or overlay

How actions map to stages

How to avoid action duplication across pages

4. Observability vs Explanation

Ensure future stages do not overload the UI.

Assess:

What belongs “above the fold”

What should be collapsible

What should remain advisory vs authoritative

How to avoid overwhelming users as stages increase

5. Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

Your recommendations MUST follow these rules:

❌ Do not invent new backend states or fields

❌ Do not assume Smartlead or personalization is live

❌ Do not suggest heuristic or inferred execution

✅ All future stages are observational placeholders only

✅ Canonical execution truth remains unchanged

✅ UI remains non-blocking and non-prescriptive

Deliverables

Produce only the following (no code):

UX Risk Assessment

Where current UI will break or become confusing as stages expand

Future-Safe UI Model

How navigation, campaign detail, and actions should evolve

Explicitly show how later stages fit without redesign

Recommended Changes (Categorized)

P0: Must adjust now to avoid rework

P1: Safe to defer

P2: Optional / enhancement

Explicit Non-Recommendations

Clearly list what should not be changed yet and why

Execution Readiness Check

Confirm whether current UI is “safe to proceed” with backend expansion

Success Criteria

This output should allow us to:

Confidently proceed with backend execution expansion

Avoid future UI rewrites

Maintain execution clarity across all lifecycle stages

Keep the UI fast, neutral, and governance-aligned

❗ Important

This is a design and planning exercise only.
Wait for explicit approval before implementing anything.
