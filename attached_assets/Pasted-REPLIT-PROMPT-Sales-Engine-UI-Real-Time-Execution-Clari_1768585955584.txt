REPLIT PROMPT — Sales Engine UI: Real-Time Execution Clarity (P0)

Repo: nsd-platform-shell
Area: Sales Engine Campaign Detail UI
Mode: Inspect → Propose → Implement
Priority: P0 (Operator UX & Execution Observability)

Objective

Optimize the Campaign Detail experience so a user can answer, in under 10 seconds:

What stage is executing right now?

What has already completed vs what’s pending?

Is the system working or waiting?

Is action required from me, or should I wait?

If results are “zero,” is that expected or a problem?

This must be frictionless, glanceable, and real-time, without overwhelming the user.

Architectural Constraints (Do Not Violate)

UI is read-only (no mutations)

UI reflects backend truth only (no inference)

All timestamps are UTC from API → displayed as ET

Execution stages are canonical:

org_sourcing

contact_discovery

lead_creation

Discovery success ≠ Promotion success (must be visually distinct)

Zero leads promoted is not an error if discovery succeeded

Phase 1 — Inspect Current UX (Required)

First, inspect and summarize:

Current Campaign Detail layout

Where execution status is shown (header, tab, card, etc.)

How stages are currently represented (if at all)

How often data refreshes and what triggers re-renders

Where confusion could occur today (especially:

“Completed but nothing happened”

“Is it still running?”

“Why are there zero leads?”)

⚠️ Do not change code yet.
Return a short UX gap analysis before implementing.

Phase 2 — UX Model to Implement (Authoritative)

Once inspection is complete, implement the following execution-first UI model.

1. Execution Stage Tracker (P0)

Add a vertical or horizontal Stage Tracker at the top of the Campaign Detail page.

Stages (fixed order):

Organizations Identified

Contacts Discovered

Leads Promoted

Each stage shows:

Status: Waiting | Running | Completed | Completed (No Output) | Failed

Sub-label with plain English meaning

Timestamp (ET)

Example:

[✓] Organizations Identified
    55 organizations sourced

[●] Contacts Discovered
    Running — scanning organizations for contacts

[ ] Leads Promoted
    Pending — requires email-qualified contacts


Rules:

Only one stage may be “Running” at a time

Completed stages never animate

“Completed (No Output)” must be visually distinct from “Failed”

2. Active Stage Focus Panel (P0)

Directly below the tracker, add an Active Stage Panel that answers:

“What is the system doing right now?”

This panel updates live and is the primary attention anchor.

Panel Contents

Stage name (large)

Status sentence (human readable)

Live signal (only if running)

“Last updated X seconds ago”

Examples

“Discovering contacts across 55 organizations”

“Promotion complete — no contacts met email requirements”

“Waiting for execution worker”

No technical jargon. No IDs. No raw JSON.

3. Results Breakdown Cards (P0)

For completed stages, show compact breakdown cards:

Contact Discovery Card
Contacts Discovered
────────────────────
Total: 214
With Email: 38
Without Email: 176
Status: Inventory Created

Lead Promotion Card
Leads Promoted
──────────────
Eligible: 38
Promoted: 12
Skipped:
- Missing email: 26


Rules:

Numbers must reconcile

Skips must be explained, not implied

Never show “0” without explanation text

4. Execution Health Indicator (P0)

Replace vague “Completed” messaging with a single health line:

✅ “Execution completed successfully”

⚠️ “Execution completed — limited promotable leads”

❌ “Execution failed during contact discovery”

⏳ “Execution in progress”

This line should be visible without scrolling.

5. Action Guidance (P1, Advisory Only)

Add a non-blocking advisory callout based on final state:

Examples:

“Most contacts lacked email. Consider enabling email enrichment.”

“Campaign completed successfully. Review promoted leads.”

“No organizations matched the ICP. Review keywords or geography.”

Rules:

No buttons required

No forced actions

Pure guidance

6. Live Refresh & Polling UX (P0)

Ensure:

Polling occurs only while execution is active

Polling interval is visible (e.g., “Auto-refreshing every 7s”)

Manual refresh button is always available

UI never “freezes” silently

If execution is idle:

Stop polling

Clearly state “Execution idle”

Phase 3 — Visual & Cognitive Design Rules

Prioritize text clarity over graphics

Use color only for status, not decoration

Avoid dense tables during execution

No emojis

No acronyms without labels

One primary focus area at a time

Deliverables

UX gap analysis (short)

Updated Campaign Detail UI implementing:

Stage Tracker

Active Stage Panel

Results Breakdown Cards

Execution Health Indicator

Advisory Callouts

Ensure ET timestamps are displayed consistently

Ensure UI updates cleanly during live execution

Non-Goals

❌ No backend changes

❌ No schema assumptions

❌ No new API endpoints

❌ No execution control buttons

❌ No analytics dashboards

Success Criteria

A first-time user can open a campaign and immediately understand:

Where execution is

What has happened

Why results look the way they do

Whether action is needed

No guessing. No digging. No second-guessing.
