You are working inside the **nsd-platform-shell** repository.

This is a **UX/UI enhancement phase**, not a backend or architecture phase.

All Observations-First plumbing, proxy routes, execution semantics, and invariants are already implemented.
**DO NOT introduce new APIs, execution paths, or data sources.**

Your task is to **polish, align, and elevate the UX/UI** so the system clearly tells the correct business story and is usable by both operators and executives.

---

## CONTEXT (DO NOT CHANGE)

The system is built on these **non-negotiable principles**:

1. **Governance ≠ Execution**

   * `campaign.status` is administrative only
   * Execution state comes from execution-state APIs

2. **Market Reality ≠ Operational Yield**

   * `observations.*` = market reality
   * `public.*` = what we processed
   * Gaps are opportunities, NOT failures

3. **Zero Is Valid**

   * `VALID_EMPTY_OBSERVATION` is informational, not an error

4. **Run Intent Is Explicit**

   * `HARVEST_ONLY` = safe, validation, no outreach
   * `ACTIVATE` = full execution

5. **UI is READ-ONLY by default**

   * Dashboards do not execute campaigns
   * Execution controls are scoped and explicit

All of this already exists in code.
You are improving **how it looks, reads, and feels**.

---

## PRIMARY UX GOALS

1. **Make the system self-explanatory**

   * A first-time executive should understand:

     * Is the system healthy?
     * Are campaigns working?
     * Is the market big enough?
     * Are we converting opportunity into yield?

2. **Eliminate ambiguity**

   * No confusing “failure” states
   * No hidden assumptions
   * Every number should explain *what it represents*

3. **Increase trust**

   * Clear labels
   * Consistent terminology
   * Explicit source attribution (Market vs Operational)

---

## SCOPE OF WORK

### 1. Campaign Detail Page UX Polish

**Build on existing components:**

* `CampaignHealthSummary`
* `DualFunnelVisualization`
* `ExecutionStatusBanner`
* `RunIntentSelector`

Enhancements:

* Improve spacing, hierarchy, and typography
* Add subtle section headers:

  * “Administrative State”
  * “Last Execution Outcome”
  * “Market Reality”
  * “Operational Yield”
* Add inline helper text (ℹ️ icons) explaining:

  * Why gaps are normal
  * Why zero ≠ failure
* Ensure outcome badges use consistent tone and color mapping

NO new data. Presentation only.

---

### 2. Executive Dashboard UX Elevation

Route: `/sales-engine/executive`

Enhancements:

* Improve visual grouping:

  * System Health (top)
  * Market Reality (left)
  * Operational Yield (right)
  * Campaign Distribution (bottom)
* Add lightweight data annotations:

  * “Observed, not processed”
  * “Processed subset of observed”
* Use neutral, executive-friendly language
* Ensure all charts are:

  * Read-only
  * Clearly labeled
  * Free of execution affordances

---

### 3. Terminology & Copy Consistency Pass

Audit all visible UI copy and enforce:

* “Governance Status” (never “Campaign Status” alone)
* “Execution Outcome” (never “Success / Failure”)
* “Market Reality” vs “Operational Yield”
* “Valid Empty Observation” messaging consistency

Replace vague labels like:

* “Ready”
* “Blocked”
* “Failed”

With explanatory phrasing.

---

### 4. Visual Hierarchy & Design System Alignment

* Normalize spacing across observability components
* Use consistent badge sizes and colors
* Ensure warning states are:

  * Rare
  * Justified
  * Actionable
* Information states should feel calm and non-alarming

No redesign. This is **polish**, not re-architecture.

---

### 5. Empty & Edge State Excellence

Improve UX for:

* No runs yet
* Valid empty observation
* Execution service temporarily unavailable
* Campaign archived / paused

Each state must:

* Explain what is happening
* Explain what is NOT happening
* Avoid implying error when none exists

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS

❌ Do NOT:

* Add new APIs
* Add execution logic
* Change backend behavior
* Introduce new data sources
* Reinterpret execution semantics

✅ DO:

* Improve clarity
* Improve layout
* Improve readability
* Improve confidence

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE

* UI tells a clear, honest story
* No ambiguous states
* Executives can understand outcomes in <60 seconds
* Operators can diagnose without reading logs
* UX reinforces Observations-First architecture

Proceed incrementally.
Start with campaign detail UX, then executive dashboard, then copy consistency.

**This is a UX refinement pass on a mature system. Treat it as such.**
