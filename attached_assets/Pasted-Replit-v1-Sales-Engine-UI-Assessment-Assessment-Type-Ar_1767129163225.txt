Replit v1 – Sales Engine UI Assessment

Assessment Type: Architecture + Functional Gap Review
Target State: M67 (Sales Engine UI)
Contract Authority: SALES_ENGINE_UI_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md v1.1 (PASS)
Verdict: ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION — NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR M67

1. Executive Summary (Plain English)

Replit v1 demonstrates that:

The Sales Engine UI was started in the correct repo (Platform Shell)

The correct API namespace (/api/v1/campaigns) is used

The UI is visually consistent with Command Center

However:

❌ Replit v1 implements only ~30–40% of required M67 functionality
❌ Critical lifecycle, governance, and monitoring capabilities are missing
❌ The UI does not yet represent the Sales Engine as an end-to-end system

Bottom line:
Replit v1 is a navigation + stub UI, not a Sales Engine UI.
It cannot be accepted for M67-02 or beyond without substantial expansion.

2. What Replit v1 Got Right ✅

These are important and should be preserved.

2.1 Correct Architectural Placement

✅ Implemented inside the NSD Platform Shell, not as a standalone app
✅ Uses existing routing + layout conventions
✅ Respects “pure frontend” posture (no backend logic)

This aligns correctly with:

Platform Shell responsibilities

M67-01 contract authority boundaries

2.2 Correct API Namespace Usage

✅ Calls are made to /api/v1/campaigns
✅ No usage of legacy /api/campaigns/* detected
✅ No Supabase, ODS, or service-key leakage

This fixes the earlier “quotes vs campaigns” confusion.

2.3 Visual & Brand Alignment

✅ Typography and spacing generally consistent with Command Center
✅ No neon/glow violations
✅ Layout feels familiar to existing NSD internal tools

3. Critical Gaps (Why v1 Is NOT Acceptable)

These are blocking gaps, not polish items.

3.1 Campaign Creation Is Incomplete ❌
What Exists

A “Create Campaign” screen with:

Campaign name

(Possibly) description

What Is Required (Per M60 + M67)

Campaign creation must include full ICP configuration, not just a name.

Missing required ICP fields:

❌ Keywords (array)

❌ Locations (structured, multi-entry)

❌ Industries

❌ Employee size range (min/max)

Impact:

Campaigns created via v1 cannot be validly used by the Sales Engine

Replit UI is not aligned with the actual POST /api/v1/campaigns contract

Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL

3.2 Governance Metadata Is Ignored ❌
M60 Reality

GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id returns governance flags:

canEdit

canSubmit

canApprove

isRunnable

Replit v1 Reality

UI does not consume or enforce these flags

Buttons and actions appear static or incomplete

No conditional affordances based on governance state

Impact:

UI risks violating lifecycle rules

Users could see actions they are not allowed to perform

Violates M67-01 contract explicitly

Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL

3.3 Lifecycle Transitions Are Missing ❌
Required Lifecycle (M60)
DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW → RUNNABLE → ARCHIVED

Missing in Replit v1

❌ Submit for review (POST /:id/submit)

❌ Approve campaign (POST /:id/approve)

❌ Confirmation modals

❌ Actor attribution (submittedBy, approvedBy)

❌ State-based UI locking after submission

Impact:

Campaigns can never leave DRAFT

Sales Engine cannot progress operationally

UI breaks end-to-end flow

Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL

3.4 No Monitoring or Observability UI ❌
Required by M67-05

Campaign detail must expose read-only observability:

Required Tab	Endpoint
Metrics	/metrics, /metrics/history
Runs	/runs, /runs/latest
Throughput	/throughput
Variants	/variants
Replit v1

❌ No metrics

❌ No run summaries

❌ No throughput visibility

❌ No variants tab

Impact:

Sales Engine appears “dead” even when active

No transparency into readiness or performance

Breaks executive + operator trust

Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL

3.5 No M65 / M58 Block Reason Surfacing ❌
M60 Requires UI to Display:

MISSING_HUMAN_APPROVAL

NO_LEADS_PERSISTED

INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS

DAILY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

etc.

Replit v1

❌ No canonical error rendering

❌ Generic or missing error states

❌ No explanation of why a campaign is blocked

Impact:

Users cannot diagnose issues

Forces back-channel debugging

Violates observability intent of M60

Severity: 🟠 HIGH

3.6 Sales Engine ≠ Quote System (Conceptual Drift) ⚠️

While the namespace is now correct, UX patterns still resemble quote/OMS flows:

“Create” feels like a form, not a campaign configuration

No ICP mental model

No lifecycle emphasis

This suggests Replit may still be:

“Building a UI that looks like Sales Engine, but thinks like Quotes.”

Severity: 🟠 HIGH (Conceptual)

4. What This Means Architecturally
Important Clarification (Answering Your Question Directly)

“Could it be that because the app was connected to the platform shell repo it read the wrong thing?”

Yes — partially.

But the real issue is:

Replit built a shell-integrated UI,

without a full functional spec of the Sales Engine end-to-end process.

Now that:

M67-01 is PASS

The M60 extract is authoritative

The Command Center role is clearly defined

➡️ The next prompt must be much more explicit and prescriptive.

5. Acceptance Status
Area	Status
Architecture placement	✅ PASS
Namespace & API discipline	✅ PASS
Campaign creation	❌ FAIL
ICP builder	❌ FAIL
Lifecycle transitions	❌ FAIL
Governance enforcement	❌ FAIL
Monitoring & observability	❌ FAIL
End-to-end Sales Engine flow	❌ FAIL
Overall Status

❌ REJECT v1 FOR M67
➡️ Must revise with a detailed, end-to-end functional build prompt
