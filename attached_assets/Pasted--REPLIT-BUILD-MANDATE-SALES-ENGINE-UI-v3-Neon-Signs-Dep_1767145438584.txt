🔒 REPLIT BUILD MANDATE — SALES ENGINE UI v3

Neon Signs Depot | Target-State Aligned | Governance-Safe

You are implementing Sales Engine UI v3.
This iteration must complete the end-to-end Sales Engine user journey using existing backend capabilities only, while strictly adhering to the Sales Engine UI Architecture Contract (M67-01) and M60 UI Enablement constraints.

This is not a redesign for aesthetics alone.
This is a Sales Operator Command Interface.

1️⃣ PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
v3 must:

Expose all Sales Engine capabilities already implemented in backend

Provide a clear human mental model for campaign lifecycle and responsibility

Introduce a Sales Engine Home Dashboard for situational awareness

Correct UX semantics and status language globally

Align visuals with NeonSignsDepot.com brand

Preserve strict governance boundaries (no execution logic in UI)

⚠️ Do not add routes outside this map.

3️⃣ SALES ENGINE HOME DASHBOARD (NEW — REQUIRED)
Purpose

Provide situational awareness, not configuration.

Must Display (Read-Only):

Total campaigns by status

Campaigns requiring attention

Recently executed campaigns

Aggregate metrics (from M56/M59):

Leads created

Replies received

Campaigns approved

Campaigns executed

Must NOT:

Execute campaigns

Edit campaigns

Override approvals

This page is allowed under target architecture.

4️⃣ GLOBAL STATUS LANGUAGE REWRITE (CRITICAL)
Internal Status → UI Label Mapping
Backend Status	UI Label (v3)
DRAFT	Draft
REVIEW	Pending Review
APPROVED	Approved
RUNNABLE	Approved & Ready ← REQUIRED CHANGE
ARCHIVED	Archived
Rules

Backend enums remain unchanged

UI must never display “Runnable”

“Approved & Ready” must appear consistently:

Lists

Detail views

Badges

Filters

Empty states

5️⃣ CAMPAIGN SETUP UI (EXPAND — DO NOT SIMPLIFY)
Add AI Campaign Draft Generator

Primary CTA: “Generate Draft with AI”

AI output must:

Populate ICP fields

Suggest keywords & locations

Include rationale text

Human must be able to edit everything

Required Disclaimers

“AI suggestions are advisory only. Human review is required.”

Required Visibility

ICP normalization preview

Keyword deduplication

Location scope clarity

6️⃣ APPROVAL UX (HUMAN AUTHORITY ENFORCEMENT)

Approval is not a button — it is responsibility.

Required Approval Modal

Must show:

Campaign summary snapshot

ICP hash

Throughput caps

Confirmation language:

“By approving, you confirm this campaign complies with sourcing, budget, and governance rules.”

Approval must feel deliberate and accountable.

7️⃣ EXECUTION UX (SAFETY FIRST)
Before Execution, UI Must Show:

Approval confirmation

Readiness indicators

Throughput limits

Last validation timestamp

Execution CTA Language

Use:

“Launch Campaign”
Not:

Execute

Run

Start

Execution is always human-initiated.

8️⃣ MONITORING & METRICS UX
Group metrics into:

Yield (leads, replies, conversions)

Efficiency (reuse, dedupe)

Quality (AI vs Human agreement)

Safety (rate limits, blocks)

Metrics must tell a story, not just show numbers.

9️⃣ VISUAL & BRAND ALIGNMENT (MANDATORY)
Align with NeonSignsDepot.com

Clean, modern, confident

High whitespace

Minimal borders

Purposeful color usage

Design Rules

No neon effects

No decorative animations

Color indicates state or action only

Typography hierarchy must be clear

This should feel like a premium internal control room, not a generic SaaS admin panel.

🔟 SALES ENGINE UX SUCCESS CHECKLIST (USE THIS)

v3 is complete only if all are true:

 Sales Engine Home Dashboard exists

 “Runnable” never appears in UI

 “Approved & Ready” used consistently

 AI Campaign Generator is present and usable

 Human approval requires explicit confirmation

 Execution is gated, intentional, and safe

 Monitoring shows grouped, meaningful metrics

 UI teaches the system as it’s used

 No backend logic in frontend

 No contract violations (M60 / M67-01)

🔚 FINAL CONSTRAINTS

Do not invent APIs

Do not bypass governance

Do not simplify away responsibility

Do not assume user knowledge

This UI must earn trust, not just function.

✅ Deliverables for v3

Updated Sales Engine UI with new Home Dashboard

Global status language rewrite

AI campaign drafting surfaced

Brand-aligned visual refinements

Screenshots or walkthrough demonstrating end-to-end journey

This is a convergence build.
Make the Sales Engine UI match the sophistication of the system behind it.
