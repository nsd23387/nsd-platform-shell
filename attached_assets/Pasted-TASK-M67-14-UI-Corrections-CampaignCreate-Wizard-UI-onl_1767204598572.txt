TASK: M67-14 UI Corrections – CampaignCreate Wizard (UI-only)

SYSTEM CONTEXT
This UI implements CampaignCreate v1. Campaign creation is the ONLY allowed mutation.
No sourcing, execution, approval, or learning behavior may be introduced.
All changes must be UI-only and must NOT alter payload semantics beyond removal of invalid fields.

DO NOT:
- Add new backend calls
- Add new execution logic
- Add sourcing decisions
- Infer intent, volume caps, or readiness
- Change CampaignCreate API contract

---

REQUIRED UI CHANGES

1. REMOVE INVALID FIELDS (HARD REQUIREMENT)
Remove the following inputs entirely from the UI and payload:
- "Max Organizations"
- "Source Type"
- "Technologies"
- "Minimum Signals Required"

These fields violate v1 semantics (no caps, no UI-driven sourcing, no gating).

---

2. ICP STEP – FIELD PRIORITIZATION
Update ICP Definition step:
- Mark Keywords as REQUIRED
- Mark Geography as REQUIRED
- Visually promote both fields (top of step or emphasized grouping)
- Add helper text:
  - Keywords: "Primary drivers of organization sourcing. At least one required."
  - Geography: "Defines where organizations are sourced from. Required."

---

3. ORGANIZATION SOURCING STEP
- Remove all quantity or cap-related inputs
- Replace content with a read-only explanation:
  “Organizations are sourced automatically based on ICP criteria. Full population sourcing is assumed.”

No user inputs required on this step in v1.

---

4. OUTREACH CONTEXT – DEFAULTS
Add UI-only default suggestions (editable):
- Value Propositions (pre-filled examples)
- Pain Points (pre-filled examples)
- Calls to Action (pre-filled examples)

Defaults are static for now. Do NOT add persistence or learning.

---

5. CAMPAIGN TARGETS (SIMPLIFY)
Reduce Campaign Targets to ONLY:
- Target Leads
- Target Emails
- Target Reply Rate

Keep existing non-gating disclaimer.
Remove all other target fields.

---

6. NAVIGATION UX IMPROVEMENT
Replace horizontal stepper with a left-hand vertical step navigation:
- Always visible
- Shows all steps
- Clear current/completed/upcoming states

This is a visual/layout change only.

---

7. TOOLTIP & HELP TEXT
Add concise tooltips for:
- Keywords (why they matter)
- Geography (why required)
- Campaign Targets (benchmarks only, non-gating)

---

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- UI no longer allows population caps
- Mandatory fields match CampaignCreate validation rules
- Payload excludes removed fields
- No backend or contract changes
- CampaignCreate POST still succeeds unchanged
- UX clearly communicates sourcing and benchmarking semantics

OUTPUT
Provide:
1. List of components/files updated
2. Before/after screenshots (if available)
3. Confirmation no backend behavior was modified
