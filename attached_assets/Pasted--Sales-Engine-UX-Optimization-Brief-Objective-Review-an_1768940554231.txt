# Sales Engine UX Optimization Brief

## Objective

Review and optimize the Sales Engine app to be **campaign-focused** with effective information hierarchy optimized for the user journey. Evaluate whether all current navigation sections (Dashboard, Campaigns, Approvals, Runs, Monitoring) are necessary or if we can simplify the experience.

---

## Current State

### Existing Navigation Structure
```
/sales-engine/home         → Dashboard (throughput, attention items, recent runs)
/sales-engine/             → Campaigns list (main listing with filters)
/sales-engine/campaigns/[id] → Campaign detail (Overview, Observability, Learning tabs)
/sales-engine/campaigns/new  → Campaign creation wizard
/sales-engine/approvals    → Pending approvals list
/sales-engine/runs         → Approved/ready campaigns + safety gates
/sales-engine/monitoring   → Performance metrics + run history
```

### What Already Exists (Build On This)
- Comprehensive campaign detail page with real-time execution status
- Pipeline funnel visualization (Organizations → Contacts → Leads → Messages)
- Execution timeline and stage tracking components
- NSD brand design tokens implemented in `/app/sales-engine/lib/design-tokens.ts`
- 40+ observability components in `/app/sales-engine/components/observability/`
- Read-only governance model (no direct execution controls)

---

## Key Questions to Resolve

### 1. Navigation Consolidation
The current 5-section navigation may be redundant for a campaign-focused app:

| Current Section | Primary Purpose | Redundancy Assessment |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Dashboard | Quick stats, attention items | Could be campaign list header? |
| Campaigns | Campaign listing | Core - must keep |
| Approvals | Pending approvals queue | Subset of campaigns with status filter? |
| Runs | Ready campaigns | Subset of campaigns with status filter? |
| Monitoring | Aggregate metrics | Could fold into Dashboard or campaign detail? |

**Recommendation to evaluate:** Simplify to 2-3 sections:
- **Campaigns** (primary) - with smart filters for approvals, ready, etc.
- **Dashboard** (optional) - only if aggregate metrics add value
- Remove standalone Approvals/Runs/Monitoring if they're just filtered campaign views

### 2. User Journey Optimization

**Primary User Journeys:**

1. **Campaign Manager Journey**
   - Create campaign → Submit for approval → Monitor execution → Review results
   - Key insight: All actions center on individual campaigns

2. **Approver Journey**  
   - See campaigns pending review → Review details → Approve/reject
   - Key insight: Could be a filter on campaigns list, not separate page

3. **Operations Journey**
   - Check system health → Identify blocked campaigns → Investigate issues
   - Key insight: Dashboard summary + campaign drill-down

**Principle:** Route users to campaign detail as quickly as possible. The campaign detail page should be the primary workspace.

### 3. Information Architecture

**Campaign List View - Should Surface:**
- Campaign name and status (clear visual hierarchy)
- Latest execution state (idle, running, completed, blocked)
- Key metric: contacts discovered / leads promoted
- Time since last activity
- Quick action: View details

**Campaign Detail View - Already Comprehensive:**
- Overview tab: Scope, status, pipeline funnel
- Observability tab: Execution timeline, stage tracking
- Learning tab: Performance signals

**Dashboard (if kept) - Should Surface:**
- System health at a glance (throughput usage)
- Campaigns needing attention (blocked, failed, stale)
- Aggregate metrics ONLY if actionable

## NSD Brand Guidelines (Must Follow)

### Color Palette
```typescript
primary: '#020F5A'    // Navy - headers, active states
secondary: '#692BAA'  // Purple - secondary actions, accents
cta: '#CC368F'        // Magenta - primary CTAs only (sparingly)
```

### Semantic Status Colors (NO red/yellow/green literals)
```typescript
semantic: {
  active: { bg: '#E0E7FF', text: '#3730A3' },    // Indigo - running
  positive: { bg: '#E0E7FF', text: '#3730A3' },  // Indigo - completed
  attention: { bg: '#FEF3C7', text: '#92400E' }, // Amber - needs review
  critical: { bg: '#FEE2E2', text: '#991B1B' },  // Coral - failed/blocked
  muted: { bg: '#F3F4F6', text: '#6B7280' },     // Gray - idle/pending
}
```

### Typography
- Headers: Poppins (600 max weight)
- Body/UI: Inter
- NO bold (700+) fonts
- Generous white space (4px grid)

### UI Principles
- Prefer borders over fills
- Minimal shadows (borders instead)
- Calm, editorial aesthetic
- No urgency-inducing elements
- Read-only indicators where appropriate

---

## Proposed Simplified Structure

### Option A: Minimal (Recommended)
```
/sales-engine/              → Campaigns list with smart header stats
/sales-engine/campaigns/[id] → Campaign detail (keep as-is)
/sales-engine/campaigns/new  → Campaign creation
```
- Fold dashboard stats into campaigns list header
- Use filters for approvals/runs/monitoring views
- Single navigation focus

### Option B: Two-Section
```
/sales-engine/              → Dashboard + campaigns combined
/sales-engine/campaigns/[id] → Campaign detail
/sales-engine/campaigns/new  → Campaign creation
```
- Dashboard section above campaigns list
- Collapsible or tabbed metrics area

### Option C: Keep Dashboard Separate (Current + Cleanup)
```
/sales-engine/home          → Dashboard (simplified)
/sales-engine/              → Campaigns list
/sales-engine/campaigns/[id] → Campaign detail
/sales-engine/campaigns/new  → Campaign creation
```
- Remove Approvals, Runs, Monitoring as standalone pages
- Add filters to campaigns list for these views

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Files to Review
- `/app/sales-engine/page.tsx` - Campaigns list
- `/app/sales-engine/home/page.tsx` - Dashboard
- `/app/sales-engine/approvals/page.tsx` - Consider removing
- `/app/sales-engine/runs/page.tsx` - Consider removing
- `/app/sales-engine/monitoring/page.tsx` - Consider folding in
- `/app/sales-engine/components/ui/NavBar.tsx` - Update navigation

### Files to Preserve (Working Well)
- `/app/sales-engine/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx` - Campaign detail
- `/app/sales-engine/components/observability/*` - All observability components
- `/app/sales-engine/lib/design-tokens.ts` - Brand tokens
- `/app/sales-engine/hooks/*` - Real-time execution hooks

### Design Token Reference
Import from: `import { NSD_COLORS, NSD_RADIUS, NSD_TYPOGRAPHY } from '../lib/design-tokens';`

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Simplified Navigation**: Reduced from 5 sections to 2-3 maximum
2. **Campaign-Centric**: Users land on campaigns, detail page is primary workspace
3. **Information Density**: Right info at right time, no redundant views
4. **Brand Compliance**: All UI uses NSD design tokens, no hardcoded colors
5. **Mobile Consideration**: Works on tablet (1024px minimum)
6. **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features remain accessible

---

## Out of Scope

- Changes to campaign detail page (already optimized)
- Changes to campaign creation wizard
- Backend API changes
- Authentication/authorization changes
