Your plan is approved and directionally correct.
To ensure this fully resolves the execution ambiguity and unblocks downstream work, please incorporate the following clarifications and acceptance criteria.

🔒 Clarification 1 — Timeline Must Be Outcome-Oriented, Not Status-Oriented

The Execution Timeline must explicitly answer:

Did execution do work?

Did execution intentionally do nothing?

Is the system waiting or finished?

This means:

Do not rely on raw labels like running, queued, or idle alone

Always include a plain-language outcome statement at the end of the timeline

Example (acceptable):

✓ Run created
✓ Queue evaluated
ℹ️ No eligible execution steps were found
Execution completed without external calls


Example (not acceptable):

Status: Running
Execution mode: Queue

🔒 Clarification 2 — Explicit “Apollo Not Reached” Messaging When Applicable

When execution completes without queue pickup or phases:

The UI must explicitly state that no external services were contacted

Example copy (or equivalent):

“This execution completed without entering any sourcing phases. No external data providers were contacted.”

This is critical to prevent users from debugging Apollo unnecessarily.

🎯 Required UX Additions (Must-Haves)

Please add these lightweight, read-only UX components alongside the timeline:

1. Execution Confidence Badge (1-second signal)

A compact badge near the campaign title:

🟢 Execution Completed (No Work Required)

🟡 Execution Idle (Expected)

🔵 Execution In Progress

⚪ Not Yet Executed

This replaces ambiguous “Running” semantics.

2. “What Should I Do Next?” Card (Single Recommendation Only)

When execution completes with no work:

Next Step
This campaign completed without executing any sourcing steps.
Recommended action:
• Review ICP or sourcing criteria before re-running


Rules:

Exactly one recommendation

Advisory only

Never framed as an error

3. Inline “Why?” Tooltips

Add tooltips for terms like:

Queue mode

Idle

No work detected

These should explain behavior calmly and non-technically.

🧪 Acceptance Criteria (This Is the Definition of Done)

This work is complete when:

✅ A user can determine in under 10 seconds:

Whether execution happened

Whether it was expected

Whether action is required

✅ A user never needs logs to answer:

“Did Apollo run?”

✅ “Nothing happened” is clearly shown as a valid, completed state

✅ No backend code, schemas, or APIs were changed

✅ No speculative inference is introduced

🚫 Explicit Non-Goals (Reminder)

No execution logic changes

No retries or forcing queue states

No backend status normalization

No cron / worker visibility

No new endpoints

This is explainability only, not execution control.

🧠 Final Guiding Principle

When in doubt, optimize for:

User confidence, not system detail

The UI should make the system feel intentional, even when it does nothing.
